I work on problems involving fracture mechanics, fatigue, corrosion, reactive transport, and multiphysics coupling, with an emphasis on creating robust numerical tools that can capture the initiation and growth of damage in metals, composites, ceramics, soft materials, and natural systems.","A significant part of my work involves advancing computational glaciology. I develop numerical methods to study rift propagation, hydrofracture driven by meltwater, supraglacial lake drainage, and iceberg calving. These models help improve our understanding of ice-shelf stability, fracture processes in Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and broader climate-driven changes in cryospheric systems. My contributions include poro-damage formulations, continuum damage models, and high-order finite element approaches tailored for large-deformation geophysical problems."],"rightParagraphs":["Beyond research, I actively supervise postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, collaborate across engineering and geoscience disciplines, and contribute to advancing computational mechanics through committee leadership, journal reviewing, and conference organization.
